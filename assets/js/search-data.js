This post surveys statistical tools—error bars, reliability measures, Bayesian models—that show and help manage this variance. Overall, it highlights how incorporating established statistical practices can make evaluations more trustworthy and informative.",

I&#39;ll formalize the generative model around which the algorithm is based, derive the EM updates, explain why pruning is needed (and how it&#39;s done), and point out the spots where the practical implementation defined by the SentencePiece library diverges from the pretty mathematical models. I hope this post provides a new lens through which to look at the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm while pointing out some interesting potential extensions/revisions to the current implementation.",
